# Project 1

## Overview

We've all been told not to mess around with magnets near computers, or we'll cause problems. 
But what about messing around with magnets *in* computers to solve problems?
In this twist on classic 'Rush hour' games, you must solve challenging puzzles 
without ever directly interacting with the puzzle pieces. To solve the puzzle, you can only alternate 
between positive and negative electrical fields on each border of the game board.

## Proposal

I plan to make a casual puzzle game that builds off of the ideas presented in games like 'Rush Hour' or 'Gridlock'; 
shifting axis locked blocks to clear a path and free another piece from the game board.
The main change from other games of similar nature is that the only direct control the player will have 
over the game board will be that they can alter the states of magnetic fields on each side of the board, 
switching between off, positive, and negative states to pull or repell pieces with certain magnetic poles.

The game is a bit more abstract than its predicessors, lacking much of a grounding in reality besides basic scientific 
principles. Due to this slight attachemnet to science, I plan to keep the aesthetics simple, but possibly resembling 
a science experiment of sorts, almost like it would belong in a laboratory or a workshop. The music, sound effects, and overall 
atmosphere of the game will aim to be playful but relaxed, to encourage patience, experimentation, and calculated thought. The game 
is meant to be more of a mind exercise and thought puzzle, rather than a frustrating challenge or race against time. 

Controlls will be simple, mouse clicks to change the states of magnetic fields, and in line with the target atmosphere 
of the game, this will be introduced alongside a simple explanation of magnetic fields. The player will have a single 
switch and a single block and can observe how the magnetic field pushes or pulls depending on its state. The player 
will then be presented with a single field and two blocks that have alternating poles, to show how they will have opposite 
reactions to each magnetic field. From here the game will continue to intoduce several other concepts such as blocks being 
stopped by other blocks, and the effect that multiple magnetic fields can have.

Several options for additional content could be blocks that have a powerful enough magnetic field of their own to shift other blocks, 
blocks that spin instead of shifting, or magnetic fields with a limited number of "charges".

It is unlikely that the game will be mobile friendly and will remain focused on desktop use, 
due to the possiblity that the number of pieces on the screen may make the game harder to view on smaller devices.
